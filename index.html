<p> Computer programming is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computer problem to executable solutions.
It involves understanding, analyzing, and solving problems that result in algorithms, which are then coded into a target
programming language. Computer programming serves the purpose of automating specific tasks or solving defined problems
and requires expertise in various subjects such as application domains, formal logic, and specified algorithms.
The history of computer programming dates back to the 1800s with Ada Lovelace being referred to as the first programmer
for her work on Charles Xavier’s Analytical Engine. Programming has evolved significantly over the years and is
essential in today’s technologically advanced society. Programmers create and work with programs that millions of people
use daily.
There are several high-level programming languages used for computer programming, including Java, C++, C#, and Python.
Each language uses a compiler or interpreter to translate your code into machine language for execution by the computer.
To get started with computer programming, one can choose a good book on the subject and learn the basics of a specific
programming language. Additionally, there are numerous programs available as interpreters for different languages that
can help you see your ideas come to life.
Programming languages have unique features and uses. For instance, Java is a standardized object-oriented programming
language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. C++ is an object-oriented programming language developed by Bjarne
Stroustrup at Bell Laboratories in the early 1980s.
